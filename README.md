# Flood Prediction and Detection using Satellite Imagery

## Targeted Problem and Goal:
The flood prediction model is complex due to the consideration of various factors like geographical location, hydrology and human activities.
Previous research paper review: Supervised Machine learning algorithms can face challenges in predictions due to complexity of the data, the amount of time required for computation.
Hence the goal is to implement supervised as well as unsupervised machine learning models on satellite imagery, tidal, rainfall data to understand which method is more robust and gives better flood prediction accuracy.

## Data Description:
1. INSAT Images (jpg format) extracted with Python Script from IMD website. https://mausam.imd.gov.in 
2. Weather Data (json format) collected from OpenWeather API. https://openweathermap.org
3. Tidal Data (json format) collected from MareaAPI https://api.marea.ooo/ <br>
All these data were collected for a duartion of one month after every 15 minutes
